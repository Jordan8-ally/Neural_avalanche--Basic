# Neural_avalanche-Basic
I implemented SOC in a neural network where the neuron firing pattern follows a power-law distribution, indicative of criticality. I have implement a threshold-based model where neurons only fire when a certain input level is reached. Then, I simulated the network over time and collected data on the size and frequency of neuron avalanches.
